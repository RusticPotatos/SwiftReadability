      <h1>Structured Headline</h1>
      <p>This fixture ensures JSON-LD is preferred when present.</p>
      <p>It includes an author, description, keywords, and a publish date.</p>
      <p>Content should be long enough to be considered primary article text.</p>
      <p>Extra sentences keep the content above minimal length thresholds.</p>
